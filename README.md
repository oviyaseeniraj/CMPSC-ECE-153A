This repository contains my files from the cross-listed course CMPSC/ECE 153A/253A at UC Santa Barbara. I took this course in Fall 2024, with Professor Forrest Brewer.

This course covers higher level fundamentals of embedded systems than ECE 153B (Sensor and Peripheral Interface Design).
Similarities between the two courses were the use of interrupts and handlers, but this course focused on the higher-level integration of embedded systems.
I worked primarily in C, but rather than register-level programming, the use of Xilinx Vivado for block design factored out a significant amount of the more low-level ECE 153B work.
Labs were written in Xilinx Vitis IDE, which allowed me to optimize and analyze my programs through memory allocation and the Performance Analyzer.

Some key concepts:
- Latency
- Hierarchical finite state machines
- Real-time scheduling (RMS, EDF)
- Processor scheduling
- Signal Processing, especially Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs)

This course completes the track/specialization of Computer Systems Design, aka Embedded Systems, at UCSB (ECE 153A+B).
